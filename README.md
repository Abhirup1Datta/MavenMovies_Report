# MavenMovies_Report
The aim of the project is to analyze the Revenue and Customer data for the MavenMovies movie rental business database using MySQL and create an interactive report using PowerBI. 
Using standard data normalization practices we created 5 tables in MySQL from the Database and imported the tables into PowerBI via Power Query.
Added relationships between tables to create a variety of visualizations that provide an in-depth product and customer base summary.
